        Cascading Style Sheets (Cascading Style Sheets or Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS ) is a markup language that offers extra possibilities in the field of text and formatting in addition to HTML .

    It can be used to prepare universal templates for web pages, as well as to independently change the style of the letters, namely their properties such as color , font, size. The most important feature of this technique is the flexibility in its use.

    A few colors and a few fonts that are compatible with each other are used in a Web page, and instead of specifying them separately on each page, they can be defined once with the help of CSS and used in common on all Web pages. Thus, the size of the pages in memory is considerably reduced, and it is also easier to update.

    CSS codes can be written into HTML codes or processed by creating an external CSS file. They can take place according to their type <BODY>or in their <HEAD>sections. Also , CSS file can be added to worksheet with  code. Storing them in a separate file or files allows them to be used by different HTML pages, makes it easier to format the same page for different devices, and makes changes economical by separating presentation and structure.
